**_bspwm_** is a tiling window manager that represents windows as the leaves of a full binary tree.

It only responds to X events, and the messages it receives on a dedicated socket.

_bspc_ is a program that writes messages on _bspwm's_ socket.

_bspwm_ doesn't handle any keyboard or pointer inputs: a third party program (e.g. _sxhkd_) is needed in order to translate keyboard and pointer events to _bspc_ invocations.

The outlined architecture is the following:

```
        PROCESS          SOCKET
sxhkd  -------->  bspc  <------>  bspwm
```

# üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

The default configuration file is `~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc`: this is simply a shell script that calls _bspc_.

For keybindings, you have to use a third party program, in my case [sxhkd](https://github.com/jorgeloopzz/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc), since _bspwm_ is just a tiling window manager and it doesn't have the hability to bind keys as i3 or many other WMs.

For the same reason you have to choose a status bar, for my desktop environment I use [polybar](https://github.com/jorgeloopzz/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/polybar) but there are so many like yabar, tint2, etc.
