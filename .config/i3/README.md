> [!IMPORTANT]
>  - If you want my status bar you'll need my [i3status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorgeloopzz/dotfiles/master/.config/i3status/config) config also. You can use another status bar as polybar too.
>  - So that you don't have any problem, clone [this](https://github.com/rpieja/i3spotifystatus) repository and change [the path](https://github.com/jorgeloopzz/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/i3/config#L243C1-L243C1) on config, it basically shows current song playing in Spotify, or just delete that line if not interesting for you.
